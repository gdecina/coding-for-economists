Coding languages tend to be more object-oriented or functional, with the object-oriented approach originating with Alan Turing's \"Turing Machines\" and the functional approach with Alonso Church's \"lambda calculus\". These two approaches are mathematically equivalent and, on a more practical note, high-level programming languages often mix both. As examples, Haskell is strongly a functional language, statistics language R leans toward being more functional, Python is slightly more object oriented, and powerhouse languages like Fortran and C are object-oriented. However, despite being less functional than some languages, Python does have lambda functions, for example:"

For example, if you had a dataframe with a column of string called 'strings' that you want to change to “Title Case” and replace one phrase with another, you could use lambda functions to do that (there are better ways of doing this but this is useful as a simple example):"

Python uses 'duck typing' (\"if it walks and quacks like a duck, it is a duck\") which means that if a variable walks like an integer, and talks like an integer, then it gets treated as if it is an integer. Ditto for other variable types. Duck typing is useful if you just want to code quickly and aren't writing production code.\n",

    "But... there are times when you *do* know what variable types you're going to be dealing with ahead of time and you want to prevent the propagation of the wrong kinds of variable types. In these situations, you can clearly say what variable types are supposed to be. And, when used with some other packages, typing can make code easier to understand, debug, and maintain.\n",
