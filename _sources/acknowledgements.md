## Contributing

Contributions are welcome!

The easiest way to contribute is to give this book's [Github page a star](https://github.com/aeturrell/coding-for-economists). You could also tweet about it using the hashtags `#Econtwitter` and `#datascience`. Both of these help others find the book.

You can make suggestions, requests, and point out bugs or mistakes by [raising an issue](https://github.com/aeturrell/coding-for-economists/issues) on the Github repository for the book. You can also make [pull requests](https://github.com/aeturrell/coding-for-economists/pulls) with fixes, edits, or new content.

If you're thinking of making a contribution, especially of a new page, it's usually best to open an issue before starting to work on anything. This will allow you a chance to talk the new content over with the maintainers of the site. There is an official [dockerfile](https://github.com/aeturrell/coding-for-economists/blob/main/Dockerfile) for the project; you can find more about how to use it and build the book over on the GitHub [readme](https://github.com/aeturrell/coding-for-economists#coding-for-economists).
