    "\n",
    "**pandas** isn't the only game in town, not by a long way—though it's by far the best supported and the most fully featured. **pandas** is a good default package to use for data in the vast majority of cases. But it's always good to have options—or, put another way, options have value! Other dataframe libraries may have a syntax that you prefer (**datatable**'s syntax is popular with some) or provide a speed-up in certain situations, for example when working with large datasets (**polars** promises to breeze through big data far faster than pandas can).\n",

    "[**datatable**](https://datatable.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is another dataframe based way to do analysis, and it has quite a different syntax to **pandas** for data manipulation. **datatable** is very fast, not the fastest dataframe option out there, but it holds its own. Its other major advantage is that it is comfortable running on extremely large (think 50GB) datasets. Most other dataframe packages (including in other languages) cannot cope with this.\n",
    "\n",
    "In datatable, almost all operations are achieved via so-called 'square-bracket notation'. Operations with a (data) Frame are almost all expressed in the form\n",

    "DT[i, j, ...]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "where `DT` is a datatable dataframe, `i` is the row selector, `j` is the column selector, and `...` is a space that could be filled by other commands (potentially several). However, `i` and `j` aren't just positional, as they might be in a **numpy** array or a list, they do a lot more than that. Datatable allows `i` to be anything that can conceivably be interpreted as a row selector: an integer to select a row, a slice, a range, a list of integers, a list of slices, an expression, a boolean-valued Frame, an integer-valued Frame, an integer **numpy** array, a generator, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "Likewise, `j` is also really versatile. It can be used to select a column by name or position, but it will also accept a list of columns, a slice, a list of booleans indicating which columns to pick, an expression, a list of expressions, and a dictionary of expressions. The j expression can even be a python type (such as int or dt.float32), selecting all columns matching that type!\n",

    "To change an entry (entries), you can use `DT[i, j] = new_value`, and to remove it (or them), it's `del DT[i, j]`."

Although most useful in a situation where data are being regularly updated, for example when producing a monthly index, these tools can also be useful if you want to be extra careful with your data in a research paper, if you are scaling up from a sample to a bigger dataset, or if you are updating an existing project.\n",

So rather than just saying it's an integer, a data validation library might say that a column must be an integer between 0 and 100.\n",

    "## Data Orchestration\n",
    "\n",
    "Data orchestration is the automation of data-driven processes from end-to-end, including preparing data, making decisions based on that data, and taking actions based on those decisions. Think of a data pipeline in which you extract data (perhaps from files), transform it somehow, and load it into where you want to put it (downstream in your research process, or perhaps into an app). \n",
    "\n",
    "Going into details of data orchestration is outside of the scope of this book, so we won't be seeing a practical example, but we think it's important enough to mention it and to point you to more resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are some truly amazing tools out there to help you do this on a production scale. Perhaps the best known and most suited for production are AirBnB's [**Airflow**](http://airflow.incubator.apache.org/) and Spotify's [**Luigi**](https://github.com/spotify/luigi). Airflow in particular is widely used in the tech industry, and doesn't just schedule data processes in Python: it can run processes in pretty much whatever you like. Both of these tools try to solve the 'plumbing' associated with long-running batch processes on data: chaining tasks, automating them, dealing with failures, and scheduling. Both Luigi and Airflow have fancy interfaces to show you what's going on with your tasks. \n",
    "\n",
    "Data orchestration tools typically have a directed acyclic graph, a DAG, at the heart of how tasks are strung together. This defines how different tasks depend on each other in order, with one task following from the previous one (or perhaps following from multiple previous tasks). It's an automation dream.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, for a research project, it's hard to recommend these two tools as they're just a bit too powerful; Airflow in particular can do just about anything but has a steep learning curve. So, instead, to show the power of data orchestration we'll use a more lightweight but also very powerful library: [**dagster**](https://dagster.io/), which bills itself as 'a data orchestrator for machine learning, analytics, and ETL [extract, transform, and load]'. Some of the key features are being able to implement components in various tools, such as Pandas and SQL, define pipelines as DAGs, and to test the same setup on your machine that you then deploy to cloud. Like the other tools, it has a nice visual interface to show what's happening."
